  # 1. The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains
  # as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram
  # of carbon 12; its symbol is "mol."
  #
  # 2. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified
  # and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles,
  # or specified groups of such particles. 
  #
  # 1 mol consists of 6.0221415Ã—10^23 atoms.
