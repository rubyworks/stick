                   Extended math library : Remarks

extmath does not implement Bessel functions, spherical harmonics,
hypergeometric functions etc. I could implement them but the
computation of that kind of functions is quite involved and
error-prone so that in my opinion it is a bad idea to have more than
one project that does implement them (bundle forces). I strongly
suggest supporting the development of GSL (the GNU Scientific
Library) and write Ruby bindings for this library.

As far as the function names for area functions are concerned I did
interpret the principle of least surprise that it requires
consistency with the names already used by Ruby 1.8. In mathematical
formulae

  * Area cosinus hyperbolicus is not called acosh but arcosh.
  * Area contangens hyperbolicus is not called atanh but artanh.
  * Area sinus hyperbolicus is not called asinh but arsinh.
  * Area tangens hyperbolicus is not called atanh but artanh.
