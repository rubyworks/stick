= Unit Equality

Equality is a broader issue for unit systems, then it is for
the usual type system, since two aspect of a thing are being
compared, the measures value and it's unit.

  require 'stick/units/si'

== Case Equality

Check case equality of prime units.

    1.g.assert  === 1.g
    1.kg.assert === 1.kg
    1.N.assert  === 1.N

    1.g.assert  === 10.g
    1.kg.assert === 10.kg
    1.N.assert  === 10.N


== Value Equality

Check value equality of prime units.

    1.g.assert  == 1.g
    1.kg.assert == 1.kg
    1.km.assert == 1.km

    1.g.refute  == 10.g
    1.kg.refute == 10.kg
    1.km.refute == 10.km

Check value equality of commensurate prime units.

    1.kg.assert == 1000.g
    1.km.assert == 1000.m

    1000.g.assert == 1.kg
    1000.m.assert == 1.km

Check value equality of commensurate prefixed units.

    1000000.g.assert  == 1.Mg
    0.001.g.assert == 1.mg

Check value equality of compound units.

    1.g.m.assert  == 1.g.m
    1.kg.m.assert == 1.kg.m

    1.m.g.assert  == 1.g.m
    1.m.kg.assert == 1.kg.m

Check value equality of commensurate compound units.

    1.kg.m.assert == 1000.g.m
    1.km.s.assert == 1000.m.s

    1.m.kg.assert == 1000.g.m
    1.s.km.assert == 1000.m.s

    1.s.kg.refute == 1000.g.m


== Unit Equality

Check unit equality of like units.

    1.g.assert.equals? 1.g
    1.kg.assert.equals? 1.kg
    1.km.assert.equals? 1.km

Check unit inequality of commensutate units.

    1.kg.refute.equals? 1000.g
    1.km.refute.equals? 1000.m

    1000.g.refute.equals? 1.kg
    1000.m.refute.equals? 1.km

Check unit equality of commensurate prefixed units.

    1000000.g.refute.equals? 1.Mg
    0.001.g.refute.equals? 1.mg

Check unit equality of compound units.

    1.g.m.assert.equals? 1.g.m
    1.kg.m.assert.equals? 1.kg.m

    1.m.g.assert.equals? 1.g.m
    1.m.kg.assert.equals? 1.kg.m


== Identity Equality

TODO: Check identity equality of like units.
This may need fixing.

    1.g.assert.eql? 1.g
    1.kg.assert.eql? 1.kg
    1.km.assert.eql? 1.km


== Commensurate Equality

Two measures are commensurate when their units ar the
same or can be converted to be the same, irregardless
of the powers of those units.

    1.kg.assert.commensurate? 1.kg
    1.kg.assert.commensurate? 1.g

    1.kg.assert.commensurate? 1.kg**2
    1.kg.assert.commensurate? 1.g**2


== Proportional Equality

Two measures are proportional when their units are
exactly the same or can be converted to be exactly 
the same --including their power.

    1.kg.assert.proportional? 1.kg
    1.kg.assert.proportional? 1.g

    1.kg.refute.proportional? 1.kg**2

Check proportional equality of commensurate prefixed units.

    1000000.g.assert.proportional? 1.Mg
    0.001.g.assert.proportional? 1.mg

== Systemtic Equality

Two measures are systemic when all their units
are from the same unit system.

    1.kg.assert.systemic? 1.kg
    1.kg.assert.systemic? 1.g

Check proportional equality of commensurate prefixed units.

    1000000.g.assert.systemic? 1.Mg
    0.001.g.assert.systemic? 1.mg
