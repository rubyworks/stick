= Unit Operations

Unit operations include all the typical numerical operations.

  require 'stick/units/si'

== Unit Power

Unit power is used to create a measure of a squared, cubic
or higher diemension units. It works just like the normal
power method (#**) except that it leaves the measure numerical
value unchanged.

  (1.m^2).assert == 1.m * 1.m
  (2.m^2).assert == 2.m * 1.m


== Power

  (1.m ** 2).assert == 1.m * 1.m
  (2.m ** 2).assert == 2.m * 2.m


== Multiplication

Multiplication with scalars.

  (1.m * 1).assert == 1.m
  (1.m * 2).assert == 2.m
  (3.m * 2).assert == 6.m

Multiplication of like units.

  (1.m * 1.m).assert == 1.m^2
  (2.m * 3.m).assert == 6.m^2

  (2.m * 3.m * 4.m).assert == 24.m^3

  (1.N * 1.kN).assert == 1001.N

Multiplication of unlike units.

  (1.m * 2.g).assert == 1.m * 1.g * 2


== Division

Division with like units.

  ((2.m^2) / 2.m).assert == 1.m

Division with scalars.

  (1.m / 1.m).assert == 1
  (2.m / 1.m).assert == 2


== Addition

  (1.m + 1.m).assert == 2.m


== Subtraction

  (2.m - 1.m).assert == 1.m


== Inversion

  2.m.invert.assert == 0.5 * (1.m^-1)
